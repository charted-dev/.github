# charted
> Free, open source, and reliable Helm Chart registry made in Go.

## What is charted-dev?
This is the organization behind the **charted-server** software vendored by [Noelware](https://noelware.org).

This project is made by [Noel](https://floofy.dev) and [Ice](https://winterfox.tech) to provide a reliable and in-cloud solution to hosting Helm Charts on the web without messing around with S3 or any other provider.

**charted** is at the moment, closed-sourced due to be in heavy development, we will release the repositories once **charted** has reached the beta stage.
