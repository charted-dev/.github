**charted** is a free and open platform to reliably push your Helm Charts into the cloud without any effort on your part, well... except writing them!

The platform was created to have a [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) like registry where anyone can post Helm Charts onto the cloud easily! ...without all the Docker Hub quirks like ratelimiting and whatnot.

> **Note** At the moment, we have not open private testing just yet! Wait until Q1 or Q2 of 2023 where we plan to create a landing page on [charts.noelware.org](https://charts.noelware.org).
